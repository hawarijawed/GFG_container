/*
You are given two strings pat and tar consisting of lowercase English characters. You can construct a new string s by performing any one of the following operation for each character in pat:

Append the character pat[i] to the string s.
Delete the last character of s (if s is empty do nothing).
After performing operations on every character of pat exactly once, your goal is to determine if it is possible to make the string s equal to string tar.
