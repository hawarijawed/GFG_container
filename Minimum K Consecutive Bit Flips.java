/*
You are given a binary array arr[] (containing only 0's and 1's) and an integer k. In one operation, you can select a contiguous subarray of length k and flip all its bits (i.e., change every 0 to 1 and every 1 to 0).

Your task is to find the minimum number of such operations required to make the entire array consist of only 1's. If it is not possible, return -1.
