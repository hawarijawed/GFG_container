/*
Given two strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS). If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given string by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
For example, "ABE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE".
