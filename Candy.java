/*
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array arr[]. You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating than their neighbors get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute.

Note: The answer will always fit into a 32-bit integer.
