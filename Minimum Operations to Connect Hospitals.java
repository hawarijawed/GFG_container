/*
You are given an undirected network of V hospitals numbered from 0 to V - 1, represented as a 2D array edges[][], where each element edges[i] = [u, v] denotes a direct connection between hospital u and hospital v.
In one operation, you are allowed to remove any existing link and reconnect it between two hospitals that are currently not directly or indirectly connected.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make sure that all hospitals become connected, either directly or indirectly, using the given links.


Note: If it is impossible to connect all hospitals into a single network, return -1.
